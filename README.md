# Real Time Boston Bus Tracker

Description of the project: 
> This pulls all busses that are in transit and displays them onto the map. There is also the feature to set the map style on the bottom of the page, next to where you can see the number of buses in transit. The popup boxes for every bus is displayed with text containing the bus number and occupancy status. The map updates every 4 seconds. 

How to Run: 
> The Tracker runs automatically with no need to clone the repo or enter in an API Access Token of any kind. Simply load the the webpage and the data will display automatically.

Roadmap of future improvements: 
- The ability to select which route you want to recieve available buses from.
- The popup for each bus can be more sophisticated with data display. 
- Use user location to display nearest bus in transit.
